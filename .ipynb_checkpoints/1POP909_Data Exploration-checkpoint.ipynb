    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The below delves into the exploration and analysis of MIDI data sourced from the POP909 dataset, a collection of music tracks. The script is structured into distinct sections, each fulfilling a crucial role in understanding and processing the musical information contained within the MIDI files. Initially, the code demonstrates how to play MIDI files using the mido library, enabling auditory examination of the music. Following this, it employs the pretty_midi library to analyze MIDI data, extracting essential details such as tempo, time signature changes, and characteristics of pitched instruments. Visualizations, including histograms and scatter plots, are generated to visualize note distributions and assess pitch consistency over time. Furthermore, the code performs key signature analysis across multiple MIDI files, revealing common patterns in time signatures and expected music keys within the dataset. **Overall, this code provides a comprehensive framework for exploring MIDI music data, offering valuable insights.**"
